# Worker Script
this is my brand new TPT2 AI script for workers!
It's pretty simple to use, and basically fully customizable!
REQUIRES 11 ACTIONS MINIMUM!!!!
Edit the script called edit me!
Use keys R, B, G, Y, and P to change the task of the red, blue, green, yellow and pink groups respectively.
O turns on the UI.
The arrows on the UI are buttons! Click any color to change the task of that group to what task the arrow is pointing at.
F turns off the UI.
R changes the UI after changing the edit me script.
Nothing really happens if you remove the keybinds.
There are 9 total scripts in the pack.
