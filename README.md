# Worker Script
this is my brand new TPT2 AI script for workers!
It's pretty simple to use, and basically fully customizable!
REQUIRES 11 ACTIONS MINIMUM!!!!
Edit the script called edit me!
Use keys R, B, G, Y, and P to change the task of the red, blue, green, yellow and pink groups respectively.
O turns on the UI.
The arrows on the UI are buttons! Click any color to change the task of that group to what task the arrow is pointing at.
F turns off the UI.
R changes the UI after changing the edit me script.
Nothing really happens if you remove the keybinds.
There are 9 total scripts in the pack.

also contains alot of global variables sorry
# Master UI
This is what the rest of my scripts' UIs will be based on!
I won't make a Master UI-less version of each of them. Just add an impulse yourself.
2 scripts
# Auto-Mine
Click the button and it will mine every single layer in your mine tab!
Remember to generate the first layer of the tab, or you have to mine one yourself.
